                                        respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of
                                        COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
                                        to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
                                        safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or
                                        sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p>
                                    <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object
                                        that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly
                                        their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                                    <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces,
                                        there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are
                                        shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen

                                            kills viruses that may be on your hands.</p>

                                        <p>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who
                                            is
                                            coughing or sneezing.</p>
                                        <p><b>Why?</b> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets
                                            from
                                            their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can
                                            breathe
                                            in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the

                                            or
                                            sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.</p>
                                        <p><b>Why?</b> Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you

                                    <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through

                                        COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
                                        to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
                                        safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or
                                        sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p>
                                    <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object

                                        their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                                    <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces,
                                        there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are
                                        shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen
